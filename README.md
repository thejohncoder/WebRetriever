# WebRetriever
A neat automated multiple Webpage retriever.


#You can use this in a windows environment with PHP installed.
So to use this correctly, you can use Windows 10 Task Scheduler to run this PHP script.

#Create an input file "weblist.dat" (its a text file) with a list of URLs to retreive the HTML.
