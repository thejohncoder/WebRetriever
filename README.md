# WebRetriever
#A neat automated multiple Webpage retriever.  It will save to a folder named for today's date.  If one with the same folder name exists already, it will create another folder with a hypen attached to same name.


#You can use this in a windows environment with PHP installed.
#So to use this correctly, you can use Windows 10 Task Scheduler to run this PHP script.

#Create an input file "weblist.dat" (its a text file) with a list of URLs to retreive the HTML.
